<h1 align= "center"> Swarm Sense Spring 2026 Project Roadmap</h1>

## Product Summary
Swarm-Sense is a centralized visualization platform designed to connect robotics systems on a local network and synchronize their sensor data into a single, intuitive dashboard. This product roadmap outlines the development strategy from February 2026 through the April 15, 2026 conference presentation, with key milestones for sensor integration, data recording, MATLAB export capabilities, and scalability to support up to 5 robots simultaneously.

## Product Goals & Success Criteria
### Main Objectives
- Enable connection to all UTC Robotics Lab robots with multi-brand robot support
- Provide real-time visualization of sensor data with low latency (<100ms)
- Support concurrent monitoring of up to 5 robots
- Implement data recording and export to MATLAB format
- Create an intuitive dashboard interface
### Success Criteria
- Successful connection and data streaming frmo at least one robot type by Ferbuary 28
- Dashboard displays real-time sensor data with visual clarity by March 15
- Data export to MATLAB verified and funcitonal by March 31
- Support for 5 simultaneous robot connections demonstrated by April 10
- System remains stable during 30-minute continuous operation
