- All robots are open source
- There are multiple sensor types that need to be displayed on the dashboard
- Internet connection and bluetooth connection to robots

- MATLAB related:
  - MATLAB export button
  - May take time to load
  - Intializing stops once neon blue

- Wants to see all camera views and sensors without having to pick apart the windows
  - Selected window zooms in when pressed (feature to consider)

- Work on delay, wants almost none. Miliseconds, but preferably no visible delay

- To each robot individually and and drop sensors
- Mostly interface design
- Grab data in real time

- Dashboard will be different based on robot
- Have indication that robot is connected
- Biweekly meetings preferred. 

- By next meeting, interface design ideas

- Problem presented:
  - Our sponsor currently has an issue where once he connects the robots and it connect the data is sparsed into small individual windows
