## Product Vision
**FOR** robotics research groups, autonomous system developers, and warehouse operators **WHO** are looking for ways to see all the data their machines are sensing in one central place. **THE** Swarm-Sense system is a centralized visualization platform **THAT** connects to robotics on a local network and synchronizes their sensor data (LiDAR, Vision, IMU, etc.) into a single, intuitive dashboard.

**UNLIKE** common visualization tools that center around a single sensor or proprietary software that is locked behind a specific brand, Swarm-Sense allows users to understand connect any robot regardless of manufacturer, visualize the sensor data in real-time in a low-latency system, and export this data for further behavior and anomalies analysis. 

Academic researchers and automated technology managers are the target customers for Swarm-Sense, as it will significantly facilitate monitoring and udnerstanding the data of multiple robots at the same time. It will provide "black box" recording capability for fleets increasing the efficiency with which failures in the robot and sensors can be solved.
